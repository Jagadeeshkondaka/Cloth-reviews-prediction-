Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('women_cloth_reviews.csv')

Preprocess the data
df['review'] = df['review'].str.lower()
df['review'] = df['review'].str.replace(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]', '')

Split the data into training and testing sets
X = df['review']
y = df['rating']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

Create a CountVectorizer object
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')

Fit the vectorizer to the training data and transform both the training and testing data
X_train_count = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_count = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the training data
clf = MultinomialNB()
clf.fit(X_train_count, y_train)

Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test_count)

Evaluate the classifier's performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
print('Classification Report:')
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
